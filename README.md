# chess

This is a simple chess game made in Ruby as part of the App Academy curriculum. Run `ruby game.rb` to try it out. My partner in class for this was Ivan Friedman.

Includes:

- Saving/loading

- A fairly stupid greedy AI

- Cursor selection of pieces and moves

- Highlighting of available moves

- Prevents players from putting themselves in check (and forces them to get out if they're in check)
